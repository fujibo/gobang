# requirement
<!-- * map -> queue(for memory and for visualizing result on-time) -->
* feature vector board -> something
* it takes a lot of time for learning, so it is needed to decrease time.
* in this algorithm, it learns on time(time depending).

# result
learning 1000 num 30
result:
```
[1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
